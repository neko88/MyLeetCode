    "To solve the problem of finding different ways to add parentheses to a given mathematical expression involving numbers and operators, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach combined with dynamic programming. The intuition behind this approach is to break down the expression at each operator, solve the subexpressions recursively, and then combine the results in all possible ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide and Conquer**: The problem can be broken down at each operator. For example, for the expression `2*3-4*5`, we can split it into two subproblems at the first operator `*`:\n",
    "   - `2` and `3-4*5`\n",
    "   - Similarly, we can split at other operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Computation**: For each split, recursively compute the results of the left and right subexpressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine Results**: Once we have the results of the left and right subexpressions, we combine them using the current operator to get the results for the entire expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memoization**: To optimize, store the results of subexpressions to avoid redundant computations (dynamic programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case**: If the expression is a single number, return it as the only possible result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Case**:\n",
    "   - Initialize an empty list to store results.\n",
    "   - Iterate through the expression. When an operator is encountered:\n",
    "     - Split the expression into left and right subexpressions.\n",
    "     - Recursively compute the results of these subexpressions.\n",
    "     - Combine the results of the left and right subexpressions using the current operator and add them to the results list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memoization**: Use a dictionary to store and reuse the results of subexpressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
