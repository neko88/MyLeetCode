    "An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. This means that any ugly number can be expressed in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{ugly number} = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are non-negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Ugly Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **1**: The number 1 is considered an ugly number by convention.\n",
    "2. **2**: Prime factors are 2.\n",
    "3. **3**: Prime factors are 3.\n",
    "4. **4**: Prime factors are \\(2 \\times 2\\).\n",
    "5. **5**: Prime factors are 5.\n",
    "6. **6**: Prime factors are \\(2 \\times 3\\).\n",
    "7. **8**: Prime factors are \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2\\).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Non-Ugly Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any number that has a prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5 is not an ugly number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **7**: Prime factor is 7 (not 2, 3, or 5).\n",
    "- **11**: Prime factor is 11.\n",
    "- **14**: Prime factors are \\(2 \\times 7\\) (7 is not allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm for Checking if a Number is Ugly:\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a given number is an ugly number, we repeatedly divide the number by 2, 3, and 5 while it is divisible by these numbers. If the result is 1, then it is an ugly number. Otherwise, it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple Python function to check if a number is ugly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def is_ugly(num):\n",
    "    if num <= 0:\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    for prime in [2, 3, 5]:\n",
    "        while num % prime == 0:\n",
    "            num //= prime\n",
    "    return num == 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "print(is_ugly(6))   # True\n",
    "print(is_ugly(8))   # True\n",
    "print(is_ugly(14))  # False\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check for Non-Positive Numbers**: Ugly numbers are positive, so if the input number is less than or equal to 0, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Divide by Prime Factors**: Repeatedly divide the number by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it is divisible by these primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check the Result**: If the final result is 1, then the original number is an ugly number. If not, it means the number had a prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function efficiently determines whether a given number is an ugly number by reducing it step by step, using only its allowed prime factors.\n",

    "The \"Ugly Number II\" problem involves finding the \\(n\\)-th ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5. The sequence of ugly numbers starts with 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by multiplying 1 by 2, 3, or 5 repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to generate ugly numbers in a sorted manner without generating duplicates. To achieve this, we can use a dynamic programming approach with three pointers corresponding to the prime factors 2, 3, and 5. Each pointer keeps track of the current smallest ugly number that needs to be multiplied by 2, 3, or 5 to generate the next potential ugly number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with the first ugly number, which is 1.\n",
    "   - Initialize three pointers, \\(p2\\), \\(p3\\), and \\(p5\\), to point to the first element in the sequence (which is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Ugly Numbers**:\n",
    "   - For each position from 2 to \\(n\\):\n",
    "     - Calculate the next potential ugly numbers by multiplying the current ugly number pointed to by \\(p2\\), \\(p3\\), and \\(p5\\) with 2, 3, and 5 respectively.\n",
    "     - Choose the smallest of these potential ugly numbers as the next ugly number in the sequence.\n",
    "     - If this next ugly number was generated by multiplying the number pointed to by \\(p2\\), increment \\(p2\\). Similarly, increment \\(p3\\) and \\(p5\\) if the next ugly number was generated by multiplying the numbers pointed to by \\(p3\\) and \\(p5\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Duplicates**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that if multiple pointers generate the same next ugly number, all corresponding pointers are incremented to avoid duplicate entries in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def nthUglyNumber(n):\n",
    "    # Initialize the ugly numbers list with the first ugly number\n",
    "    ugly_numbers = [1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Initialize pointers for multiples of 2, 3, and 5\n",
    "    p2 = p3 = p5 = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for _ in range(1, n):\n",
    "        # Calculate the next potential ugly numbers\n",
    "        next_ugly2 = ugly_numbers[p2] * 2\n",
    "        next_ugly3 = ugly_numbers[p3] * 3\n",
    "        next_ugly5 = ugly_numbers[p5] * 5\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Find the smallest next ugly number\n",
    "        next_ugly = min(next_ugly2, next_ugly3, next_ugly5)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Add the smallest next ugly number to the list\n",
    "        ugly_numbers.append(next_ugly)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Increment the corresponding pointer(s)\n",
    "        if next_ugly == next_ugly2:\n",
    "            p2 += 1\n",
    "        if next_ugly == next_ugly3:\n",
    "            p3 += 1\n",
    "        if next_ugly == next_ugly5:\n",
    "            p5 += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return the nth ugly number\n",
    "    return ugly_numbers[-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "n = 10\n",
    "print(nthUglyNumber(n))  # Output: 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `ugly_numbers` is a list initialized with the first ugly number, 1.\n",
    "   - `p2`, `p3`, and `p5` are pointers initialized to 0, indicating the position of the current multiples of 2, 3, and 5 in the list of ugly numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generating Ugly Numbers**:\n",
    "   - The `for` loop runs from 1 to \\(n-1\\) (since the first ugly number is already known).\n",
    "   - `next_ugly2`, `next_ugly3`, and `next_ugly5` are the next potential ugly numbers generated by multiplying the current ugly numbers pointed to by `p2`, `p3`, and `p5` with 2, 3, and 5 respectively.\n",
    "   - `next_ugly` is the smallest of these potential ugly numbers.\n",
    "   - Append `next_ugly` to the list of ugly numbers.\n",
    "   - Increment the pointers `p2`, `p3`, and `p5` if `next_ugly` equals `next_ugly2`, `next_ugly3`, and `next_ugly5` respectively to avoid generating duplicate ugly numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result**:\n",
    "   - After the loop completes, the \\(n\\)-th ugly number is the last element in the list `ugly_numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm ensures that ugly numbers are generated in sorted order, efficiently finding the \\(n\\)-th ugly number without generating duplicates."
