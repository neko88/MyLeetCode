    "# 495. Teemo Attacking\n",
    "Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval ```[t, t + duration - 1]```. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "    Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2\n",
    "    Output: 4\n",
    "    Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:\n",
    "    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.\n",
    "    - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.\n",
    "    Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "    - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.\n",
    "    - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.\n",
