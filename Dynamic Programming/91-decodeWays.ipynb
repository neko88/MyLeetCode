    "A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:\n",

    "...\n",
    "'Z' -> \"26\"\n",

    "\"KJF\" with the grouping (11 10 6)\n",

    "The idea behind the \"decode ways\" algorithm is to use dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently count the number of ways to decode a given string of digits into letters. The main concept revolves around breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and building up the solution by considering the validity of decoding single and double-digit numbers at each step. Here's a detailed breakdown of the algorithm's idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping**: \n",
    "   - Each digit from '1' to '9' maps to a letter 'A' to 'I'.\n",
    "   - Each two-digit number from '10' to '26' maps to a letter 'J' to 'Z'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**:\n",
    "   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring of length `i` from the start of the string.\n",
    "   - This table helps in breaking down the problem by considering subproblems of increasing length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - An empty string (`dp[0]`) can be decoded in one way (doing nothing), so `dp[0] = 1`.\n",
    "   - The number of ways to decode the string of length 1 (`dp[1]`) depends on whether the first character is '0' or not (since '0' cannot be decoded).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Transition**:\n",
    "   - For each position `i` in the string:\n",
    "     - **Single Digit Decode**: If the single digit at position `i-1` (i.e., `s[i-1]`) is valid (between '1' and '9'), then it contributes the number of ways to decode the substring up to `i-1`, i.e., `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.\n",
    "     - **Two Digit Decode**: If the two-digit number ending at position `i-1` (i.e., `s[i-2:i]`) is valid (between '10' and '26'), then it contributes the number of ways to decode the substring up to `i-2`, i.e., `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the input string \"226\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `dp[0] = 1` (empty string)\n",
    "   - `dp[1] = 1` (since '2' is a valid single digit)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - For `i = 2` (substring \"22\"):\n",
    "     - Single digit '2' is valid: `dp[2] += dp[1]` -> `dp[2] = 1`.\n",
    "     - Two-digit '22' is valid: `dp[2] += dp[0]` -> `dp[2] = 2`.\n",
    "   - For `i = 3` (substring \"226\"):\n",
    "     - Single digit '6' is valid: `dp[3] += dp[2]` -> `dp[3] = 2`.\n",
    "     - Two-digit '26' is valid: `dp[3] += dp[1]` -> `dp[3] = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The value `dp[n]` (where `n` is the length of the input string) will give the total number of ways to decode the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the Python code that encapsulates this idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:\n",
    "    if not s or s[0] == '0':\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    n = len(s)\n",
    "    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n",
    "    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: empty string\n",
    "    dp[1] = 1  # Base case: first character\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n",
    "        # Single digit decode\n",
    "        if 1 <= int(s[i-1:i]) <= 9:\n",
    "            dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n",
    "        # Two digit decode\n",
    "        if 10 <= int(s[i-2:i]) <= 26:\n",
    "            dp[i] += dp[i-2]\n",
    "\n",
    "    return dp[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "print(numDecodings(\"226\"))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses dynamic programming to iteratively build up the number of ways to decode the string by considering valid single and two-digit decodings at each step. This approach ensures that all possible decodings are accounted for in an efficient manner."

    "Great question! Let's clarify why adding the contributions from both single-digit and two-digit decodings to the current `dp[i]` does not lead to double counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distinct Contributions**:\n",
    "   - **Single-digit decode**: When we add `dp[i-1]` to `dp[i]`, we are considering ways to decode the string up to `i-1` and then using the single digit at `i` as a valid decode. This step considers how many ways there are to decode up to `i-1` and appends the single digit `s[i-1]`.\n",
    "   - **Two-digit decode**: When we add `dp[i-2]` to `dp[i]`, we are considering ways to decode the string up to `i-2` and then using the two-digit number ending at `i` as a valid decode. This step considers how many ways there are to decode up to `i-2` and appends the two-digit number `s[i-2:i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Overlap**:\n",
    "   - The single-digit decode at `i` and the two-digit decode ending at `i` represent distinct decoding paths. One is adding a single character to the decodings up to `i-1`, and the other is adding a different character (or pair of characters) to the decodings up to `i-2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example to Illustrate\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the example `\"226\"` to see why there is no double counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `i = 3`:\n",
    "  - **Single digit '6'**: We consider `dp[2]` and append 'F' (for '6'):\n",
    "    - Paths considered for `dp[2]` are: \"B\" (for '2') + \"BF\" and \"V\" (for '22') + \"VF\".\n",
    "  - **Two digits '26'**: We consider `dp[1]` and append 'Z' (for '26'):\n",
    "    - Paths considered for `dp[1]` are: \"B\" (for '2') + \"BZ\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So `dp[3]` combines `dp[2]` (ways to decode \"22\") and `dp[1]` (ways to decode \"2\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From `dp[2]` (value 2)**:\n",
    "   - \"2\" + \"6\" => \"BF\" (B is from `dp[2]`, 2 ways: \"B\", \"V\")\n",
    "   - \"22\" + \"6\" => \"VF\" (V is from `dp[2]`, 1 way: \"V\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **From `dp[1]` (value 1)**:\n",
    "   - \"26\" => \"BZ\" (B is from `dp[1]`, 1 way: \"B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "These paths are distinct, hence no double counting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"BF\" (derived from single digits '2' + '6')\n",
    "- \"VF\" (derived from two digits '22' + '6')\n",
    "- \"BZ\" (derived from two digits '26')\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Implementation Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the dynamic programming solution step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:\n",
    "    if not s or s[0] == '0':\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    n = len(s)\n",
    "    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n",
    "    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: empty string has one way to decode\n",
    "    dp[1] = 1  # Base case: first character (assuming it is not '0')\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n",
    "        # Single digit decode\n",
    "        if 1 <= int(s[i-1:i]) <= 9:\n",
    "            dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n",
    "        # Two digit decode\n",
    "        if 10 <= int(s[i-2:i]) <= 26:\n",
    "            dp[i] += dp[i-2]\n",
    "\n",
    "    return dp[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "print(numDecodings(\"226\"))  # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding contributions from both `dp[i-1]` (single digit) and `dp[i-2]` (two digits) does not lead to double counting because these two cases represent distinct decoding paths. Each decoding step either extends from the previous single-digit decode or the two-digits decode, ensuring all combinations are considered uniquely."
