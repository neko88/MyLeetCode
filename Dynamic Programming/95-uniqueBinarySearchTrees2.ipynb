    "The problem of generating all possible unique binary search trees (BSTs) that can be formed with a sequence of numbers can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming. Here's the intuition and technique to solve the problem in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding BST Structure**:\n",
    "   - A BST is structured such that for any node, its left subtree contains values less than the node's value, and its right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n",
    "   - To generate all unique BSTs for a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, we can use dynamic programming.\n",
    "   - Define `dp[i]` as the list of all unique BSTs that can be formed using the numbers 1 to i.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Base Case**:\n",
    "   - `dp[0] = [None]`: There's only one way to create a BST with no nodes, represented by `None`.\n",
    "   - `dp[1] = [TreeNode(1)]`: There's only one way to create a BST with one node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building Larger BSTs**:\n",
    "   - To construct `dp[i]`, iterate over each number `j` from 1 to i:\n",
    "     - Use `j` as the root node.\n",
    "     - All numbers less than `j` will form the left subtree (`dp[j-1]`).\n",
    "     - All numbers greater than `j` will form the right subtree (`dp[i-j]` shifted by `j`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combining Subtrees**:\n",
    "   - For each combination of left and right subtrees, construct a BST and add it to `dp[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result**:\n",
    "   - `dp[n]` will contain all unique BSTs that can be formed using the numbers 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technique (Python Implementation):\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python function that implements the above approach using dynamic programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TreeNode Class**: Represents a node in the binary search tree.\n",
    "- **generate_trees Function**:\n",
    "  - Initializes `dp` to store lists of BSTs for each number from 0 to n.\n",
    "  - Nested loops to build BSTs: `j` as the root, combining left and right subtrees.\n",
    "  - `clone_tree` function is used to create copies of the right subtree with values adjusted by `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate all unique BSTs for a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, you can call `generate_trees(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently computes all possible unique BSTs using dynamic programming, ensuring that each subtree is computed only once and reused where necessary, optimizing both time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the values of all unique BSTs generated by the `generate_trees` function, you can modify the function to return the values in a structured format, such as a list of lists or a list of tuples. Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the function to print the values of the unique BSTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modified `print_tree` Function**:\n",
    "   - `print_tree` now returns a list of values of the BST nodes in level order traversal. This is achieved using a queue-based approach.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`print_trees` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function iterates through all generated BSTs (`trees`) and applies `print_tree` to each tree, collecting the results in a list (`result`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   - `n = 3` is used as an example to generate all unique BSTs from 1 to 3.\n",
    "   - The `generate_trees(n)` function generates the BSTs.\n",
    "   - Each generated tree is printed using `print_tree` to show its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Each BST is printed with its node values in a format like `BST 1: [2, 1, 3]`, representing the structure of the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows you to visualize the structure of each generated BST by printing its node values in a readable format. Adjust the example usage (`n = 3`) to any desired `n` to generate and print BSTs for a different range of numbers."

    "Certainly! The `clone_tree` function plays a crucial role in generating unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs). This function creates a clone (deep copy) of a given tree, adjusting the values to maintain the properties of a BST. Typically, it adjusts the values by adding a certain offset (in this case, `j`) to the nodes in the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed breakdown of how `clone_tree` might be implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "- The primary purpose of `clone_tree` is to clone a given tree and adjust the values of the nodes to maintain the BST property.\n",
    "- When forming BSTs, the values in the right subtree need to be greater than the root. Thus, cloning and adjusting the values ensure that each subtree remains a valid BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a possible implementation of the `clone_tree` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "        self.left = left\n",
    "        self.right = right\n",
    "\n",
    "def clone_tree(node, offset):\n",
    "    if not node:\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a new tree node with adjusted value\n",
    "    new_node = TreeNode(node.val + offset)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Recursively clone the left and right subtrees\n",
    "    new_node.left = clone_tree(node.left, offset)\n",
    "    new_node.right = clone_tree(node.right, offset)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return new_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case (`if not node: return None`)**:\n",
    "    - If the input `node` is `None`, the function returns `None`. This handles the case of an empty subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a New Node (`new_node = TreeNode(node.val + offset)`)**:\n",
    "    - A new tree node is created with its value adjusted by adding the `offset`. This ensures that the values in the cloned subtree are appropriately increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursively Cloning Left Subtree (`new_node.left = clone_tree(node.left, offset)`)**:\n",
    "    - The function recursively clones the left subtree of the current node, passing the same `offset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursively Cloning Right Subtree (`new_node.right = clone_tree(node.right, offset)`)**:\n",
    "    - Similarly, the function recursively clones the right subtree of the current node, passing the same `offset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the Cloned Node (`return new_node`)**:\n",
    "    - The function returns the newly created node, which has its left and right subtrees appropriately cloned and adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in the Main Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main code block you provided, `clone_tree` is used to clone the `right_tree` and adjust its values before attaching it to the new root node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for left_tree in left_subtrees:        \n",
    "    for right_tree in right_subtrees:\n",
    "        root = TreeNode(j)\n",
    "        root.left = left_tree\n",
    "        root.right = clone_tree(right_tree, j)  # Clone right subtree\n",
    "        dp[i].append(root)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- When `right_tree` is cloned with the offset `j`, each node in the `right_tree` has its value increased by `j`. This ensures that all values in the right subtree are greater than the root node `j`, maintaining the BST property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clone_tree` function is essential for generating unique BSTs by ensuring that each subtree's values are correctly adjusted. It allows the main algorithm to build all possible unique BSTs by cloning and adjusting subtrees as needed. This function ensures that the resulting trees maintain the properties of BSTs, with values in the right subtrees always greater than their root nodes."
